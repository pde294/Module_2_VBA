#VBAStocksAnalysis
## Overview of the Project
-	The purpose of this analysis is to analyze green energy stocks in terms of their total daily volumes and returns.

##Results
-	Because I am in the process of debugging my scripts, I am basing my analysis on the run-time for the 2017 and 2018 stock data. The code ran more quickly for 2018’s data (.66 seconds) than it did for 2017’s data (.67 seconds). Please see images of the respective runtimes here:

-	Once the code is debugged, analysis could be conducted comparing 2017 and 2018 total daily volumes and returns overall, in addition to comparing results before and after the code is refactored. 

##Summary
-	The pros of refactoring coding include having a quicker runtime for programs. The cons could possibly be errors that occur in the refactored code. This may apply to the code for analyzing the green energy stocks as new variables/arrays are introduced via refactoring; it may take several iterations of trying to refactor to understand how the new variables/arrays work with the data.
